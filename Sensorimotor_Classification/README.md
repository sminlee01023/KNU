### multi-class classification

* Dataset: sensorimotor fMRI brain data (private)
* label: 4 class (auditory, visual, left-hand, right-hand)
* input data: z-scored voxel values (by Extract_voxel_value.ipynb)
* 5-fold cross-validation


This project is a work in progress.
I'm currently focusing on improving the performance of the **CNN model** through experimentation and optimization.
